<p><b><font color="#005128">Problem Definiton:</font></b></p>

<p>
  Handwritten character recognition is the process of recognizing the unique handwriting of human beings and converting them into digital form. It usually involves converting written characters from sources like images, files, documents into a machine-readable form. Convolutional Neural Network Architectures has proved to be quite efficient for Handwritten Character Recognition by learning the distinguishable traits from large datasets and recognizing the written text by understanding the shapes and characteristics of the letters. 
</p>
<p>
  However, there is a drawback to the traditional CNN architecture. Since handwriting are a unique characteristic of each individual there is wide spectrum of available data to process and thus the large computational requirement of neural network regards for large computing time. The research proposes parallelizing the architecture to future improve the computational speed. 
</p>   
<p>
  There is a wide scope of exploring the parallel and distributed computing capacities of the dedicated hardware in order to achieve high accuracy of such recognition algorithm by training the neural nets for a huge amount of data. 
</p>  

<p><b><font color="#005128">Proposed Approach:</font></b></p>

<p>
  The project suggests a multi-stream concurrent and parallel GPU-based approach for handwritten character recognition. It proposes constructing a programming environment convolutional neural network algorithm based on the CUDA architecture. GPU can efficiently speed up CNN algorithm as compared to the conventional microprocessors. 
</p>
<p>
  A neural network with three convolutions layers and two fully connected layers can be constructed from the input, hidden and output neurons. This network can be parallelized by the means of dedicated GPU using CUDA platform. CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that was developed by NVIDIA. It can be implemented using the TensorFlow Library. It is capable of achieving significant improvement in the computing speed and efficiency by utilizing the GPU’s capability.
</p>
<p>
  I plan to use the NIST dataset. It contains 8,10,000 samples of character images from 3600 different individuals. They are also classified into digits, upper case, lower case letters and free text fields.
